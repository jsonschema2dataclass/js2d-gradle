 


Gradle plugin for KotlinSchema2Pojo processor.

wrapper plugin to use https://github.com/wuseal/JsonToKotlinClass/blob/master/LIBRARY.md
# Official [jsonschema2pojo](https://github.com/joelittlejohn/jsonschema2pojo) Gradle plugin.


#### Reasoning for the plugin in the separate repo
* Publish to Gradle Plugin Repository
* Customise and extend the configuration to make it more human-readable and human-writable than it is now
* Add custom options, which are indirectly supported but was missing in the original maven-based gradle plugin.
* Add an ability to provide extensions for jsonschema2pojo library within Gradle build configuration.

**Note**: Main package is still different. I was done previously in order to state that this is not an official plugin.
